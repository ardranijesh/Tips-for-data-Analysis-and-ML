How to maintain data quality and data quantity in an analysis? Here are some tips you can follow:-

Define your research question: Before you start collecting data, make sure you have a clear research question in mind. This will help you determine the type and amount of data you need to collect. It will also help you to identify the potential sources of bias that can impact the quality of your data.

Use appropriate data collection methods: Choose appropriate data collection methods that are suitable for your research question. For example, surveys, interviews, and observational studies can be used to collect qualitative data, while experiments and randomized controlled trials can be used to collect quantitative data.

Consider the sample size: When collecting data, it's important to consider the sample size. A large sample size can improve the statistical power of your analysis and increase the precision of your estimates, but it can also increase the risk of collecting low-quality data. A small sample size, on the other hand, can be less representative of the population you're studying, but it can be easier to collect high-quality data.

Ensure data quality: To ensure the quality of your data, consider the following factors:

Validity: The data you collect should measure what it's intended to measure.
Reliability: The data should be consistent over time and across different observers.
Objectivity: The data should be collected without bias or prejudice.
Accuracy: The data should be free from errors and mistakes.

Use appropriate data analysis techniques: Once you've collected your data, use appropriate data analysis techniques to answer your research question. This could include descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, or machine learning algorithms
